    "description": "I like building things that work. Clean code, responsive systems, secure pipelines, and tools that make people's lives easier. That's where I thrive.\n\nI'm a software engineer with experience across cloud-native development, cybersecurity automation, and full-stack product design. My background includes enterprise systems at Fortune 500 companies, startup sprints, and academic research. I've worked with distributed teams, legacy codebases, blazing-fast microservices, and the occasional \"why does this even exist?\" backend. I fixed those too.\n\nI recently completed my M.S. in Computer Science from NJIT. Now, I'm focused on building tools that blend usability, security, and performance. Whether it's creating dashboards to speed up incident response, optimizing Kafka pipelines, or helping non-technical users report safety concerns through a mobile app, I enjoy writing code that solves real problems.\n\nOutside of work, you'll find me refining my deadlift form, tracking macros like a spreadsheet nerd, or experimenting with terminal tools I probably shouldn't run in production.\n\nIf you're into engineering culture, meaningful software, or discussing what tech stack would make the perfect post-workout meal tracker, let's connect.",
